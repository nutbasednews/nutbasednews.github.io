Did one of our article made you think twice about what you were eating? Here is a list of resources to find out more:

- [Dominion](https://www.dominionmovement.com/)

    We believe that in order to understand why considering veganism is so important, you need to first undersand what your purchase demands before it reaches your plate. The majority of us consume meat, diary and eggs without ever thinking about the origin of these products.

- [Land of hope and glory](https://www.landofhopeandglory.org/)

    Similar to Dominion, but shot in the UK. It highlights that it is the same anywhere you go. Your country doesn't have better practices than your neighbours.
