Did one of our article made you think twice about what you were eating? Here is a list of resources to find out more:

- [Dominion](https://www.dominionmovement.com/)

    To understand why considering veganism is so important, one first needs to understand what their purchase demands before it reaches their plate. The majority of us consume meat, dairy and eggs without ever thinking about the origin of these products. This documentary will help you with that.

- [Land of hope and glory](https://www.landofhopeandglory.org/)

    Similar to Dominion, but shot in the UK. It highlights that it is the same anywhere you go. Your country doesn't have better practices than your neighbours.

- [Challenge22](https://challenge22.com/)

- [The Game Changers](https://www.netflix.com/watch/81157840)

    Are you worried about becoming protein deficient when following a plant-based diet after going vegan? Watch this documentary on Netflix, and watch athletes thriving on such a diet.
