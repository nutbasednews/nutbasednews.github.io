            Are you related to <a href="https://plantbasednews.org">Plant Based News</a>?

            Nope! But our name was inspired by theirs.

            Why do your articles contain so many grammar and spelling mistakes?
          </h6>
          <span class="d-block text-muted">
            So many reasons why:

            <br>
            <div>1. We aren't writers</div>
            <div>2. We are doing this in our spare time</div>
            <div>3. We are a tiny team of one ðŸ¤«</div>
            <div>4. I am French ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·. Salut les vegans!</div>
            <br>
            If NBN becomes a bit more serious, I will invest in this project to avoid these mistakes.

            Is the content of your articles genuine?
          </h6>
          <span class="d-block text-muted">
            We often get inspired by facts and actual events, so part of what we write is genuine, then we get creative and add a layer of fiction. 
            <br><br>Take whatever we write with a pinch of salt. The underlying message remains the same, though. What we do to animals is ridiculous, and the cognitive dissonance is laughable (except what it leads to).
