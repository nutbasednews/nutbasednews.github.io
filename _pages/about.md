We write satirical news articles about veganism, and animal liberation. We exaggerate real events in order to highlight the cognitive dissonance many suffer from.

We do not wish to upset anyone. Our goal is to trigger something within our readers that has been buried by years of conditioning.

We are vegans, as per the [definition of The Vegan Society](https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/definition-veganism):

> Veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude—as far as is possible and practicable—all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of animals, humans and the environment. In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals
