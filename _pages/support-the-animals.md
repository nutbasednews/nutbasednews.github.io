We write satirical news articles about veganism. We exaggerate real events in order to highlight the cognitive dissonance many suffer from.

But the aim of our Patreon isn't to support us, it's to support them, the animals. We want to create a community of people who want to invest their money toward impactful causes. The bigger we grow, the bigger our funds grow, the more impact we make as a community.

We can begin by helping existing charities and sanctuaries. With time, we can help promote vegan businesses, or start creating ad campaigns to be displayed on billboards, public transport or even be broadcasted on TV.
