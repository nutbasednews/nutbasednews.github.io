Hiya ðŸ‘‹

We write satirical news articles about veganism. We exaggerate real events in order to highlight the cognitive dissonance many suffer from.

What does "we" mean? The website is so sleek that you might be thinking that we are a large team of people, but that isn't quite the case. We are only 2 people, both with full-time jobs, maintaining and creating content for Nut Based News in our spare time.

We are both vegans, ethical vegans, hard core vegans, vegans for the animals.

We may never make a career our of Nut Based News, but let's have fun while it last! Your help will help us make it last a bit longer! ðŸ’š
