Hiya ðŸ‘‹

We write satirical news articles about veganism. We exaggerate actual events to highlight the cognitive dissonance many suffer from.

What does "we" mean? The website is so sleek that you might be thinking that we are a large team of people, but that isn't quite the case. We are only one person ðŸ¤«  with a full-time job, maintaining and creating content for **Nut Based News** in my spare time.

I am vegan, an ethical vegan, vegan for the animals.

I may never make a career out of *NBN*, but let's have fun while it lasts! Your help will help us make it last a bit longer! ðŸ’š
