The British celebrity has admitted he cannot live without cow milk. Dairy milk, the substance produced by cows for their young, is mainly known to be fed to humans.

Four years ago, in an interview about veganism, vegan activist Joey Carbstrong planted a seed. Piers Morgan faced a statement he was not prepared to hear:

> You're not a baby cow, bro

This statement was aimed to clarify if Piers was a calf after claiming he liked drinking milk produced from a cow, a naturally secreted liquid to help young calves grow.

Piers Morgan finally came out of the closet and admitted not being able to survive without dairy. The celebrity made this discovery when taking a DNA test from an online service. The grown up adult discovered that dairy was necessary for his survival. Not human milk, not goat milk. Only cow milk. That would put M. Morgan in the same category as calves, sharing similar DNA traits.

This genetic anomaly has yet to be understood. Scientists worldwide are trying to figure out when this genetic mutation occurred.
