We have all heard of meat-eaters finding [chicken body parts in buckets of chicken body parts](https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/food/kfc-customer-fried-chicken-head/), or [pigs body parts in slices of pig body parts](https://www.peta.org/blog/mcdonalds-sandwich-pig-nipple-goes-vegan/).

But the unthinkable has happened. Vegans thought they would be safe from such horror, but nobody can truly avoid it.

Mark, 32, ordered a broccoli soup at a vegan cafe. As shocking as this may sound, Mark found a piece of broccoli in his soup. The restaurant had to evacuate all its customers immediately.

The cafe owner Bella has sincerely apologised and promised this would never happen again:

> What happened was a mistake on our part. We understand that our customers ordering food containing plants do not wish to see plants in their dish. The crime scene is being investigated.

After recovering from his traumatic experience, Mark told Nut Based News:

>These kinds of horror stories usually only affect meat-eaters, and as a vegan, I thought this would never happen to me. Someone orders a bucket of chicken and end up with body parts of chickens? No way! Slice of bacon with the body parts of a pig? No, thank you. A broccoli soup with bits of broccoli in it? Has the world gone mad?!

> I had to rush outside and was forced to leave all my belonging at my table.
