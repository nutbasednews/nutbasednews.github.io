The news network [GBN](https://www.gbnews.uk) invited [Christopher Snowdon](https://twitter.com/cjsnowdon) as a guest to a debate about veganism. His opponent, Ed Winters (also known as [Earthling Ed](https://www.youtube.com/c/EarthlingEdChannel)) argued in favour of veganism.

Christopher was supposed to argue against veganism, but M. Snowdon had other plans. In a stroke of genius, he argued against veganism but subliminally argued in favour of veganism.

It requires a lot of talent and skills to argue in favour of two opposite positions in the same debate.
