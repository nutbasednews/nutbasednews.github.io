I know what you are thinking. **"Part-time vegan"**, what on earth does that mean?! Don't worry, it's straight forward. [Oatly](https://www.oatly.com), the plant-based drink company has come up with a brillant new concept.

We all know someone who eats meat, but every so often, they are found to not be munching on piece of meat, egg or dairy? That is the definition of a part-time vegan, someone who takes breaks from being a full-time carnivore.

We have met with a few part-time vegans so they could share their stories.

# Charlie: Breakfast Vegan

Charlie is a proud butcher. He loves chopping animal dead bodies into smaller pieces for a living. But every morning, Charlie is vegan.

> I used to have full-english breakfast every morning: sausages, bacon, eggs, pint of milk. But then my GP told me my colesterol was a bit high, and recommended that I reduce my consumption of animal products. So I decided to only eat fruits, nuts and grains with some plant-based milk in the morning. Then I came across a post from Oatly, mentionning "part-time vegan". Then it all made sense. **I AM** a part-time vegan, what I eat in the morning is vegan. I've changed the name of my shop to "The Part-Time Vegan Butcher". People seem to like it. It makes what I do sound more humane.

# Bob: Unknowingly Vegan, Sometimes.

Everybody is like Bob. We don't know it, but we often put vegan food in our mouth unknowingly. Bob shares his story.

> I was at a steakhouse and ordered the biggest steak. I often go there, because the idea of mistakenly being served one of these fake meat scare the hell out of me. When my steak was put in front of me, my eyes just stared at this small pile of lettuce sitting next to my meat. And then it hit me like a brick: "Holy crap! That's vegan!". I woke up in a hospital bed. Apparently I had a stroke.

# Denis: A Kill Celebrated The Vegan Way

Denis is an amateur hunter. After each kill, Denis celebrates with a drink of plant-based milk, making his celebrations vegan.

> I know this will be controlversial with my fellow vegans, but as a part-time vegan hunter, I avoid animal products except from the one I kill on a hunt. I might not be as extreme as other vegans, but I still think I am 90% vegan. The only time I am not vegan, it's when I pull the trigger. But once the animal is killed, it would be a waste, and frankly disrespectful not to harvest the meat and eat it.
