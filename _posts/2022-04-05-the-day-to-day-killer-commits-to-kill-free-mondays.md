The New York serial killer known as the **Day-to-Day Killer** has committed to *kill-free Mondays*. The perpetrator has been killing at least one person every day. He has anonymously reported he would no longer murder on Mondays after the killer allegedly felt guilty when he saw a victim's relative in tears on television.

The NYPD has welcomed the decision of the serial killer when the murder forecast slightly decreased after the killer made the announcement.

> This commitment from the Day-to-Day Killer not to kill on Mondays is great news for the people of New York. It will reduce people's chances of being murdered, allowing us to focus our resources on other cases. It's a more ethical murder rate, and we are thankful that the serial killer made such a decision.

The victims' relatives were shocked by the NYPD's statement during today's press conference. In a joint statement, they said:

> It is irrelevant when or how often murder is committed. Taking the life of an innocent victim should never be praised and will always remain an unethical and immoral act.
