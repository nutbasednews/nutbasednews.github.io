After the bad press Kurt Zouma has received when a video of him was leaked kicking and slapping his pet cat, the West Ham defender has decided to adobt an animal that is less liked by the general public.

Pigs, mostly known for their meat, and consumed by so many animal lovers and defender of cats and dogs, are the perfect companion animals for these who want an intelligent animal in their home, but also have the freedom to throw, kick, and punch them whenever they feel like it, without causing such uproar.

A spokeperson told Nut Based News:

> We want to make sure everyone knows that the pig is not being kept as a pet, but instead will be raised for meat. This should allow the family to treat their pig the same way other pigs are handled on farms.

To make a point, Kurt Zouma released a new video showing himself kicking his pig the same way it is done on farms.

Many people aren't sure what to make of this situation. Lauren, a Newcastle United fan who was actively calling Kurt Zouma during their match against West Ham said:

> I love all animals and what Kurt is doing is disgusting. I am against all sort of animal abuse and would never support such horrific acts against any animals.

Unfortunately, we had to stop our interview with Lauren when she chocked on a piece of bacon as she was being shown undercover footage of what was done to pigs on farms, and slaughter houses.

It's still unclear what the RSPCA will do about this situation.

The Zouma family are planning to apply for the RSPCA Approved label as the pig will be kept in conditions way above the standards of the majority of farms.

When asked which method the family would use to slaughter their pig, they said they would choose the most common and humane method: putting the pig into a gas chamber.
