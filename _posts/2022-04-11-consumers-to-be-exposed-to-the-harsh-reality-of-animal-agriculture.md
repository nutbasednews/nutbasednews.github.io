The UK government has passed a new law that will require any businesses and brands selling animal products to show images or footage of standard practices used in animal agriculture.

This regulation is a joint effort between the **Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairs** and the **Department of Health & Social Care**. This new policy aims to help the country meet its goal of reducing its carbon footprint to **fight climate change** and promote healthier eating to **combat the rise in heart disease**.

The government is betting on people's innate compassion toward animals and hopes the images will gradually convince the public to stop consuming meat, dairy, and egg.

Money has been allocated to convert animal farms to **more sustainable agriculture** and educate the future generation on nutrition to learn how to **thrive on a balanced plant-based diet**.

Grocery items containing animal products will have to comply with the new law and show images of slaughter or living conditions on farms. A policy heavily inspired to encourage people not to smoke by having graphic pictures of cancer symptoms printed on cigarette packages.

Meat, dairy and egg aisles will need screen panels showing footage of how animals are treated on farms and slaughterhouses. These requirements will also apply to other businesses selling animal products, such as restaurants and butchers.

This new law will take effect in January 2024.
